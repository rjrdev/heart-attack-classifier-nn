# Heart Attack Risk Classifier

## Overview
This repo contains an interactive Python Notebook containing a multi-layer neural network built using Keras + Tensorflow. The goal of this classifier is to predict whether health records have an increased change of heart attack or not.

### **Tech Stack**
* **Development Environment(s):**
    * OS/Machine: Mac OS X
    * Python: Jupyter via Anaconda
* **Languages:**
    * Python
* **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    * **NumPy** - Harness library's ability to handle n-dimensional data objects and perform operations on these data objects (e.g., `np.argmax()`)
    * **Pandas** - Harness library's ability to hold, organize, and manipulate `DataFrame` objects representing datasets. To be used extensively in **Data Preprocessing/Preparation** phase of solution.
    * **Scikit-Learn** - utility functions such as `train_test_split()`
    * **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Plotting libraries to be used in plotting model performance, in addition to exploratory data analysis.
    * **TensorFlow** - End-to-end machine learning framework used to build and run machine learning models, in this case, a deep learning neural network.
    * **Keras** - A higher-level interface to develop neural networks. Built on top of **TensorFlow**.
